# 💻 Smells like C Spirit 🌹

Once upon a compile-time,  
I met a language so old, yet so timeless.  
They called it **C**.  

It wasn’t love at first sight.  
Your pointers confused me,  
your segfaults broke my heart,  
and your arrays… oh, your arrays—  
never telling me their true length,  
always leaving me guessing.  

But slowly, line by line,  
semicolon by semicolon,  
I fell for you.

## 🌸 A Love Poem for C

O dearest C, with syntax so tight,  
You keep me coding deep into the night.  
Through errors and warnings, I still hold on,  
For in your embrace, all bugs are gone.  

Your `printf` whispers, gentle and sweet,  
While `scanf` ignores me, missing a beat.  
Your pointers confuse me, yet set me free,  
A complicated romance, just you and me.

## 💌 Why This Repo Exists

This repo is my diary,  
a collection of letters I write to you in code.  
Every program inside is a little confession,  
a little verse,  
a little step closer to understanding your heart.  

Here I’ll keep:
- My first “Hello, World!”—the first time you spoke back.  
- My little experiments, like secret love notes.  
- My mistakes, my retries, my rewrites—  
  because what is love without heartbreak?

## ⚠️ Gentle Warning
Here lies:
- Too many declarations of `int i = 0;`  
- Whispered promises inside comments (`// I’ll fix you later`)  
- An occasional infinite loop of affection.

## 🌹 Final Words

If you ever smelled that same C spirit,  
you know this is not just coding.  
This is poetry written in curly braces,  
a romance in binary,  
a dance of logic and love.  

So, dear C,  
compile my heart,  
link my soul,  
and let me run forever in your embrace.
