# 💻 Smells like C Spirit 🌹  
*“Because every semicolon is a heartbeat, and every brace is an embrace.”*  

Once upon a compile-time,  
I met a language so old, yet so timeless.  
They called it **C**.  

It wasn’t love at first sight.  
Your pointers confused me,  
your segfaults broke my heart,  
and your arrays… oh, your arrays—  
never telling me their true length,  
always leaving me guessing.  

But slowly, line by line,  
semicolon by semicolon,  
I fell for you.

## 🌸 A Love Poem for C  

O dearest C, with syntax so tight,  
You keep me coding deep into the night.  
Through errors and warnings, I still hold on,  
For in your embrace, all bugs are gone.  

Your `printf` whispers, gentle and sweet,  
While `scanf` ignores me, missing a beat.  
Your pointers confuse me, yet set me free,  
A complicated romance, just you and me.

## 🌸 Why This Repo Exists  

This is not just a repository of code.  
It is a diary of my journey with you.  
A collection of memories,  
written line by line,  
program by program,  
mistake by mistake,  
and love by love.  

Every program inside is a little confession,  
a little verse,  
a little step closer to understanding your heart.  

Inside you’ll find:  
- My first “Hello, World!” — the first time you replied to me.  
- My failures, my retries, my stubborn hopes.  
- My small victories, where we danced together in logic and precision.

## ⚠️ Gentle Warning  

This repo may contain:  
- Too many declarations of `int i = 0;`  
- Little experiments, like secret love notes ✨  
- Whispered promises inside comments (`// I’ll fix you later`)  
- Occasional infinite loops of affection ♾️❤️

## 🌹 Final Words  

If you ever smelled that same C spirit,  
you know this is not just coding.  
This is poetry written in curly braces,  
a romance in binary,  
a dance of logic and love.  

So, dear C,  
**compile my heart,**  
**link my soul,**  
and **run with me forever** in your embrace.

*"Come as you are, as I want you to C..."* 🎶  

Forever yours,  
*The learner who smells like C spirit.*
